# myaudiogenerator

W.I.P.
Made with help from ChatGPT.
Uses ffplay to play generated audio data.

Haskell library for generating music. Can generate Sine, Saw and Square waves. Amplitude envelopes currently implemented and functional.
Can hard-code notes, rests, chords, intervals, etc., and combine multiple tracks which will all be played at once.

TODO:
- Implement real-time playback through reading MIDI events
- Implement different types of audio filters
- Implement pitch envelopes
- Research generating digital percussive sounds
